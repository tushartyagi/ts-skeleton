* TypeScript Project

  How difficult or easy is it to actually start writing some code in TypeScript
  without pulling in a few thousand packages and UI libraries? 

  I primarily want to write TS a lot of times *without* doing UI stuff, and this
  project hopes to do that without getting in my way.

  This skeleton project allows one to write and test TS code without a lot of
  ceremonies.

* Usage

  #+begin_src bash
    git clone https://github.com/tushartyagi/ts-skeleton.git [some-project-name]
  #+end_src
